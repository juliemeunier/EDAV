# Introduction
In recent decades, the Earth's climate has undergone unprecedented changes, primarily attributed to anthropogenic activities. One of the profound consequences of these changes is the alteration of global water cycles, impacting the availability and distribution of fresh water resources. Among the key players in this intricate system are glaciers, which store a significant portion of the planetâ€™s freshwater.

In the winter, snowfalls on the summits are transformed into ice by gravity and the weight of the upper layers. The glacier then flows slowly down to lower altitudes. At these lower altitudes, the glacier melts during the summer. In this way, glaciers serve as essential reservoirs, supplying freshwater that was stored during winter to rivers and ecosystems during summer, and supporting human communities that depend on these resources for agriculture, industry, and daily life. Although there are currently 215,000 glaciers on Earth, more than half of them are set to disappear by 2100. As the planet warms, these frozen giants are experiencing accelerated rates of melting and retreat.

The consequences of glacier retreat are multiple. In certain areas, the freshwater supply largely depends on glaciers which contribute significantly to the flow of rivers and aquifers. Many human communities rely heavily on glacial meltwater for drinking water, agriculture, and hydropower. The changing availability of freshwater resources poses risks to water security, potentially leading to conflicts and displacement in vulnerable regions. Changes in freshwater availability will also have cascading effects on ecosystems, strongly impacting biodiversity. In some parts of the world, melting glaciers are contributing to the formation of alpine lakes, endangering downstream communities. Occasionally, the wall of ice holds back the water, causing flooding and mudslides.

This data visualization project seeks to explore and evaluate the impact of climate change on freshwater resources, with a specific focus on glaciers. We aim to better understand change in availability of freshwater due to glacier retreat by evaluating communities that rely on glacier fed resources in North America and in the world, exploring the variations over the last decade and correlating low precipitation in the winter with droughts in the summer. Understanding these dynamics is paramount for policymakers, scientists, and the general public as we collectively navigate the challenges posed by climate change.
