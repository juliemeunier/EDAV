This repo contains a [Quarto book](https://quarto.org/docs/books/) template for the EDAV final project.
The dataset used contains geo data and timeseries.

The goal of this project is to:
-  identify permafrost and glacier-fed lakes and assess their importance in providing fresh water
-  identify areas and communities that heavily rely on this resource
-  identify global and seasonal trends in surface variations
-  correlate these variations with temperature and precipitations
