    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent decades, the Earth’s climate has undergone unprecedented changes, primarily attributed to anthropogenic activities. One of the profound consequences of these changes is the alteration of global water cycles, impacting the availability and distribution of fresh water resources. Among the key players in this intricate system are glaciers, which store a significant portion of the planet’s freshwater.\nIn the winter, snowfalls on the summits are transformed into ice by gravity and the weight of the upper layers. The glacier then flows slowly down to lower altitudes. At these lower altitudes, the glacier melts during the summer. In this way, glaciers serve as essential reservoirs, supplying freshwater that was stored during winter to rivers and ecosystems during summer, and supporting human communities that depend on these resources for agriculture, industry, and daily life. Although there are currently 215,000 glaciers on Earth, more than half of them are set to disappear by 2100. As the planet warms, these frozen giants are experiencing accelerated rates of melting and retreat.\nThe consequences of glacier retreat are multiple. In certain areas, the freshwater supply largely depends on glaciers which contribute significantly to the flow of rivers and aquifers. Many human communities rely heavily on glacial meltwater for drinking water, agriculture, and hydropower. The changing availability of freshwater resources poses risks to water security, potentially leading to conflicts and displacement in vulnerable regions. Changes in freshwater availability will also have cascading effects on ecosystems, strongly impacting biodiversity. In some parts of the world, melting glaciers are contributing to the formation of alpine lakes, endangering downstream communities. Occasionally, the wall of ice holds back the water, causing flooding and mudslides.\nThis data visualization project seeks to explore and evaluate the impact of climate change on freshwater resources, with a specific focus on glaciers. We aim to better understand change in availability of freshwater due to glacier retreat by evaluating communities that rely on glacier fed resources in North America and in the world, exploring the variations over the last decade and correlating low precipitation in the winter with droughts in the summer. Understanding these dynamics is paramount for policymakers, scientists, and the general public as we collectively navigate the challenges posed by climate change."

    "text": "2.1 RESEARCH PLAN\nIn this visualization project, we are using to complementary datasets:\nGLRSED which contains spatial and origin (whether it is glacier or permafrost fed or not) for numerous lakes and water reservoirs\nReaLSAT which provides us with monthly variations of these water bodies with longitude from -180 to 0 from 1984 to 2020.\nFirst, using GLRSED as a starting point, the objective will be to identify the proportion of freshwater reserves coming from melting ice worldwide. Mountain and polar regions are expected to be more dependent on glaciers for their freshwater supply. This first stage of exploration will enable us to identify critical regions whose freshwater reserves are strongly threatened by climate change.\nWe will then focus on a critical region for glacier fed fresh water bodies and a control region whose water resources do not depend on a glacier. Focusing on North and South America, we will then use the ReaLSAT dataset to compare variations in surface of fresh water lakes and reservoirs across a year between glacier or permafrost fed water bodies and some from a region assumed to be unaffected.\nFor a particular critical region and the selected control region, we can then study variations in the surface of freshwater available over the course of the year. A comparison between a high-precipitation year and a low-precipitation year will have to be carried out.\nFor this particular critical region, we will also study the variation in available freshwater over the entire available period i.e. 1984 to 2020, in an attempt to link these variations to variations in glacier volume. The expected global tendency to be observed is that the volume of available fresh water in the glacier fed bodies will decrease as the glacier retreats throughout the years."

For the HydroLAKES database, which is the amalgamation of several sources, includes topographic and remote sensing data, each with varying degrees of accuracy. For OSM data, its quality varies among different locations because it is created without any formal qualification."
