    "text": "1 Introduction\nIn recent decades, the Earth’s climate has undergone unprecedented changes, primarily attributed to anthropogenic activities. One of the profound consequences of these changes is the alteration of global water cycles, impacting the availability and distribution of fresh water resources. Among the key players in this intricate system are glaciers, which store a significant portion of the planet’s freshwater.\nIn the winter, snowfalls on the summits are transformed into ice by gravity and the weight of the upper layers. The glacier then flows slowly down to lower altitudes. At these lower altitudes, the glacier melts during the summer. In this way, glaciers serve as essential reservoirs, supplying freshwater that was stored during winter to rivers and ecosystems during summer, and supporting human communities that depend on these resources for agriculture, industry, and daily life. Although there are currently 215,000 glaciers on Earth, more than half of them are set to disappear by 2100. As the planet warms, these frozen giants are experiencing accelerated rates of melting and retreat.\nThe consequences of glacier retreat are multiple. In certain areas, the freshwater supply largely depends on glaciers which contribute significantly to the flow of rivers and aquifers. Many human communities rely heavily on glacial meltwater for drinking water, agriculture, and hydropower. The changing availability of freshwater resources poses risks to water security, potentially leading to conflicts and displacement in vulnerable regions. Changes in freshwater availability will also have cascading effects on ecosystems, strongly impacting biodiversity. In some parts of the world, melting glaciers are contributing to the formation of alpine lakes, endangering downstream communities. Occasionally, the wall of ice holds back the water, causing flooding and mudslides.\nThis data visualization project seeks to explore and evaluate the impact of climate change on freshwater resources, with a specific focus on glaciers. We aim to better understand change in availability of freshwater due to glacier retreat by evaluating communities that rely on glacier fed resources in North America and in the world, exploring the variations over the last decade and correlating low precipitation in the winter with droughts in the summer. Understanding these dynamics is paramount for policymakers, scientists, and the general public as we collectively navigate the challenges posed by climate change."

    "text": "2.1 Research plan\nIn this visualization project, we are using to complementary datasets:\nGLRSED which contains spatial and origin (whether it is glacier or permafrost fed or not) for numerous lakes and water reservoirs\nReaLSAT which provides us with monthly variations of these water bodies with longitude from -180 to 0 from 1984 to 2020.\nFirst, using GLRSED as a starting point, the objective will be to identify the proportion of freshwater reserves coming from melting ice worldwide. Mountain and polar regions are expected to be more dependent on glaciers for their freshwater supply. This first stage of exploration will enable us to identify critical regions whose freshwater reserves are strongly threatened by climate change.\nWe will then focus on a critical region for glacier fed fresh water bodies and a control region whose water resources do not depend on a glacier. Focusing on North and South America, we will then use the ReaLSAT dataset to compare variations in surface of fresh water lakes and reservoirs across a year between glacier or permafrost fed water bodies and some from a region assumed to be unaffected.\nFor a particular critical region and the selected control region, we can then study variations in the surface of freshwater available over the course of the year. A comparison between a high-precipitation year and a low-precipitation year will have to be carried out.\nFor this particular critical region, we will also study the variation in available freshwater over the entire available period i.e. 1984 to 2020, in an attempt to link these variations to variations in glacier volume. The expected global tendency to be observed is that the volume of available fresh water in the glacier fed bodies will decrease as the glacier retreats throughout the years."

The majority of the data in GLRSED comes from the HydroLAKES dataset, the OpenStreetMap dataset comes second and only a minority comes from the GRD dataset.\nAccording to the authors of the GLRSED dataset, there are a lot of missing values in the OpenStreetMap dataset which leads to lakes and reservoir not being included in GLRSED.\nIn the case of the GLRSED dataset, assessing the quality of the data is not easy as levels of accuracy vary depending on the source. For the HydroLAKES database, which is the amalgamation of several sources, includes topographic and remote sensing data, each with varying degrees of accuracy. For OSM data, its quality varies among different locations because it is created without any formal qualification.\n\n\n2.2.2 RealSAT\nIn the rest of the work, we are only using a few lakes from RealSAT.

They account for almost a third of the total surface area. This is consistent with the fact that freshwater generally flows from the peaks to the plains.\nPermafrost lakes, on the other hand, are numerous and account for almost a third of the planet’s total lake surface.\nThe majority of the lakes are natural.Nevertheless, human-built reservoir seems to be large as they account for a sixth of the global lake surface.\nSWORD lakes i.e. whether the lake is on a river or not are few in number but account for almost half of global lake surface. It means the lakes that are on rivers are large.\n\nThe rest of our work focuses on lakes created by melting glaciers and permafrost.\n\n\nCode\nvcd::mosaic(Glacier + Permafrost ~ Mountain + SWORD, count_types, direction = c(\"v\", \"v\", \"h\", \"h\"), highlighting_fill= RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(4, \"Set3\"))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe majority of permafrost and glacier-fed lakes are not located on rivers. In fact, the lakes created by melting glaciers and permafrost are located upstream near the source.\nIf glacier-fed lakes are all located in mountainous areas, permafrost lakes can also be on plains at low altitudes. Indeed, permafrost exists both at high latitudes and altitudes, the key point being that a cryosol must be permanently frozen, at least for two years, and therefore impermeable.\n\n\nCode\n#area by continents\nggplot(summary_by_country, aes(x=LakeType,  y=SumArea)) +\n  geom_col(fill=\"cornflowerblue\")+\n  facet_wrap(~Continent)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Area by Lake Types by Continent\",\n    x = \"Lake Type\",\n    y = \"Area\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth America and Asia are the continents that rely the most on permafrost and glacier water. Both Canada and Russia have a large part of their territory that is frozen all year long since they are located at high latitudes.\nUnsurprinsigly, Africa doesn’t have any glacier and permafrost lakes despite the mountainous regions as the climate doesn’t allow for durable ice. The last glaciers of Mount Kilimanjaro will disappear before 2050 due to global warming.\nThe following graphs are an attempt to create an indicator to to assess the regions’ dependence on water from glaciers and permafrost. It is based on the proportion of freshwater surface area available from glaciers and permafrost. This is only an approximation, however, and some lakes are counted twice in this indicator, as they are derived from both glacier melt and permafrost. Nevertheless, it gives an idea of the impact that the disappearance of these water sources could have in these regions.\n\n\nCode\n#indicator for ranking countries depending on how much they rely on glacier or permafrost water\ncountries_indicator &lt;- summary_by_country%&gt;%select(Country)\ncountries_indicator$percent_nLake&lt;- ifelse(summary_by_country$LakeType==\"Glacier\"|summary_by_country$LakeType==\"Permafrost\", summary_by_country$percent_nLake, 0)\ncountries_indicator$percent_area&lt;- ifelse(summary_by_country$LakeType==\"Glacier\"|summary_by_country$LakeType==\"Permafrost\", summary_by_country$percent_area, 0)\ncountries_indicator&lt;- countries_indicator%&gt;%summarize(Count = n(),percent_nLake = sum(percent_nLake), percent_area=sum(percent_area), .by = Country)\ncolnames(countries_indicator)[colnames(countries_indicator) == \"Country\"] &lt;- \"country\"\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(rnaturalearth)\n\n# Télécharger des données géospatiales pour les pays\nworld &lt;- ne_countries(scale = \"medium\", returnclass = \"sf\")\nworld$name_sort &lt;- toupper(world$name_long)\n\n# Fusionner les données géospatiales avec les données d'indicateurs\npartial_match &lt;- function(x, y) {\n  matching_indices &lt;- sapply(x, function(name) agrep(name, y, ignore.case = TRUE, value = TRUE, max.distance = 0.1))\n  matching_indices &lt;- lapply(matching_indices, function(matching_index) ifelse(length(matching_index) &gt; 0, matching_index[1], NA))\n  matching_indices &lt;- unlist(matching_indices)\n  matching_indices[!is.na(matching_indices)]\n}\n\n# Perform partial matching\nmatching_indices_indic &lt;- partial_match(countries_indicator$country, world$name_long)\nmatching_indices_world &lt;- partial_match(world$name_long, countries_indicator$country)\n\n# Merge based on matching indices\nworld_data &lt;- merge(world, countries_indicator, by.x = \"name_sort\", by.y = \"country\", all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)\n\nworld_data$percent_area[world_data$percent_area &gt; 100] &lt;- 100\n# Créer la carte du monde avec ggplot2\nggplot() +\n  geom_sf(data = world_data, aes(fill = percent_area)) +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"white\", high = \"red\", na.value = \"grey40\", name = \"Percentage\", limits = c(0, 100)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ggtitle(\"World Map with percentage of freshwater lakes surface from glacier and permafrost \")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe map above shows which countries rely most heavily on glaciers and permafrost to fill their freshwater lakes. High-latitude countries are heavily dependent on water from melting permafrost and appear in the darker shade of red here. Countries with large mountain ranges have glaciers and permafrost at altitude. They depend on these melting glaciers for their freshwater reserves in summer.\nThe indicator on proportion of area of freshwater lakes from glacier and permafrost enables us to identify the most and least ice dependent countries.\n\n\nCode\n#List of Ice dependent countries using percentage of area\nIceFed = c(\"SVALBARD AND JAN MAYEN\", \"GREENLAND\", \"ANDORRA\", \"KYRGYZSTAN\")\nNoIce = c(\"SOUTH AFRICA\", \"SUDAN\", \"ZAMBIA\", \"TANZANIA\")\nmost_ice_summary &lt;- summary_by_country %&gt;%\n  filter(Country %in% IceFed)\nleast_ice_summary &lt;- summary_by_country %&gt;%\n  filter(Country %in% NoIce)\n\nmost &lt;- ggplot(most_ice_summary, aes(x=LakeType,  y=percent_area)) +\n  geom_col()+\n  facet_wrap(~Country)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Most ice dependent countries\",\n    x = \"Lake Type\",\n    y = \"Percentage of area\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\nleast &lt;- ggplot(least_ice_summary, aes(x=LakeType,  y=percent_area)) +\n  geom_col()+\n  facet_wrap(~Country)+\n  labs(\n    title = \"Least ice dependent countries\",\n    x = \"Lake Type\",\n    y = \"Percentage of area\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\ngrid.arrange(most, least, ncol=2)\n\n\n\n\n\nComparing the different percentage of areas for ice dependent countries enables us to separate them into two categories which have already been briefly mentioned:\n\nHigh latitude countries: they don’t necessarily have high mountains but part of the territory is frozen due to being located on high latitudes and are therefore less intensely heated by the sun. The cold temperature even at low altitudes allows some land to remain frozen all year round.\nMountainous countries: despite being located on mid-range latitudes, high-altitudes mountains and plateau allow the existence of glaciers and permafrost. Heavy snowfall during the winter allow for the renewal of glaciers that partially melt in summer providing fresh water to downstream valleys.\n\nTwo trends can be noted among the countries that do not depend on ice for their freshwater resources:\n\nA larger part of fresh water lake surface is on rivers. A large amount is therefore more downstream.\nThey rely more heavily on artificial reservoirs. We will in the following that glacier-fed lakes are less impacted by drought in the summer as the glacier melting provides fresh water even when it doesn’t rain. It is not the case for other lakes which can vary greatly depending on rainfall. Building artificial reservoirs can be a solution to try and alleviate droughts.\n\nIn the rest of the work, we will focus on North America and the United States.\n\n\nCode\n# Generate sample data (longitude, latitude, and heat values)\nNorth_America &lt;- count_types\nNorth_America$longitude &lt;- GLRSED$Longitude\nNorth_America$latitude &lt;- GLRSED$Latitude\nNorth_America$Hylak_ID &lt;- GLRSED$Hylak_ID\nNorth_America &lt;- North_America%&gt;%filter(Continent == \"North America\")\n\nlon_bin_size &lt;- 1\nlat_bin_size &lt;- 1\n\n# Summarize the data into 10x10 squares\nsummarized_North_America &lt;- North_America %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    LonBin = cut(longitude, breaks = seq(-180, 180, lon_bin_size), labels = FALSE),\n    LatBin = cut(latitude, breaks = seq(-90, 90, lat_bin_size), labels = FALSE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(LonBin, LatBin) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Number_of_Lakes = n(),\n    Total_area = sum(Lake_area),\n    nMountain = sum(Mountain),\n    nGlacier = sum(Glacier),\n    nPermafrost = sum(Permafrost),\n    Latitude = (min(latitude)%/%lat_bin_size) *lat_bin_size,\n    Longitude = (min(longitude)%/%lon_bin_size) *lon_bin_size\n  )\n\narea_score &lt;- North_America %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    LonBin = cut(longitude, breaks = seq(-180, 180, lon_bin_size), labels = FALSE),\n    LatBin = cut(latitude, breaks = seq(-90, 90, lat_bin_size), labels = FALSE)\n  ) %&gt;%\n  group_by(LonBin, LatBin, Glacier, Permafrost) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Lake_area = sum(Lake_area)\n  )%&gt;%\n  filter(Glacier==1 | Permafrost==1)\n\nsummarized_North_America &lt;- merge(summarized_North_America, area_score, by = c(\"LonBin\", \"LatBin\"), all.x = TRUE, all.y = TRUE)\n\nsummarized_North_America[is.na(summarized_North_America)] &lt;- 0\n\nsummarized_North_America$score &lt;-summarized_North_America$Lake_area/summarized_North_America$Total_area *100\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(summarized_North_America, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, fill = score)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"white\", high = \"red\") +\n  borders(\"world\", regions = c(\"USA\", \"Canada\", \"Greenland\", \"Mexico\",\"Belize\",\"Costa Rica\", \"Cuba\", \"Dominican Republic\", \"El Salvador\", \"Guatemala\", \"Haiti\", \"Honduras\", \"Jamaica\",\"Martinique\", \"Nicaragua\", \"NORTHERN MARIANA ISLANDS\", \"Panama\", \"Puerto Rico\", \"Trinidad and Tobago\"), color = \"black\") +\n  borders(\"state\", color = \"black\", size = 0.5)+\n  coord_fixed(1.3, xlim = c(-180, 0), ylim = c(0, 90))+\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"lightblue\"))+\n  ggtitle(\"Dependence on Glacier and Permafrost water accross North America\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe center of Greenland appears in light blue as we don’t have any lake data for it. It could either because the lakes were not registered in the dataset or because there is no lake. As expected with the categories mentioned above, the larger part of Canada and Alaska heavily rely on permafrost water. High latitudes allow for frozen land all year round. They are high latitude category identified previously.\nIn the US, the rocky mountains show up as a red trail. The glaciers in high altitude in the mountains provide water for the area. They are part of the high altitude category identified before."

The sample chosen contains lakes from different sizes and locations accross the Rocky Mountains. A bias in this sample cannot be ruled out, as we did not focus on obtaining a representative random sample. The observations made here only serve to develop an intuition about glacial lakes in the USA. The plots and the tendency line - using loess method - are influenced by missing values. For some lakes, surface was only measured during the spring and summer. A few years are also missing.\n\n\nCode\nmelted_data &lt;- melt(US_glacier_timeseries, id.vars = c(\"year\", \"month_code\", \"month\"), variable.name = \"lake\")\n\n# Create a faceted line plot\nggplot(melted_data, aes(x = year, y = value, group = lake, color = month_code)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~lake, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Variations of Lake Surface Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Surface sq.kms\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the six glacier-fed lakes selected:\n\ntwo seem to have been decreasing in size during the last 35 years.\nthe rest seem to have a relatively stable size.\n\nThe glacier-fed lake with id 711481 seems to have been growing in size from 1985 to 2000. This could be due to increased melting of the glacier, releasing more water than before.\nOverall, we cannot conclude that there has been a significant reduction in surface area of these glacier-fed lakes. But that’s not to say that the gradual disappearance of glaciers doesn’t pose a threat to these lakes and the water supply they provide. Indeed, in recent years, glaciers have continued to melt in summer at a rate similar to or even greater than in previous decades, allowing the lakes downstream to fill up. However, winter snowfalls are no longer sufficient to compensate for summer melting, putting glaciers - the majority of which are set to disappear by 2050 - and their associated lakes at risk in the long term.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(melted_data, aes(x = month_code, y = value, group = lake, color = year)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~lake, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Seasonal Variations of Lake Surface\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Surface sq.kms\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the missing data for the winter months in some plots, a clear tendency can be highlighted for the seasonal variations of glacier-fed lake surface: the surface increases during the summer months and decreases during the winter. The explanation for this phenomenon is simple: glaciers and winter snow melt during the summer, filling downstream lakes and swelling torrents. During the winter, low temperatures prevent the glaciers from melting, so they don’t release any fresh water.\n\n\n3.2.2 Control lakes, not glacier-fed\nTo better understand the specificity of glacier-fed lakes, we will briefly look at the variations of surface from 1985 to 2020 and the monthly variations of lakes that are not glacier-fed.\nThe remark made at the previous paragraph is still valid for sampling method here. The data was formatted using the same code as before and saved in .csv.\n\n\nCode\nUS_lake_timeseries &lt;- read.csv(\"C:/Users/meuni/Documents/EDAV/final project/ReaLSAT/monthly_timeseries/US_lake_timeseries.csv\")%&gt;%select(!lake_676761)\nUS_lake_timeseries$month_code &lt;- factor(US_lake_timeseries$month_code, levels = month.abb)\nmelted_data_lake &lt;- melt(US_lake_timeseries, id.vars = c(\"year\", \"month_code\", \"month\"), variable.name = \"lake\")\n\n# Create a faceted line plot\nggplot(melted_data_lake, aes(x = year, y = value, group = lake, color = month_code)) +\n  geom_point(na.rm=TRUE) +\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~lake, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Variations of Lake Surface Over the Years\",\n       x = \"Year\",\n       y = \"Surface sq.kms\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nFour of these lakes have had their surface increase from 1985. As they are from different parts of the US it is difficult to provide a single explanation for this phenomenon. Later in this work we will explore the correlation with temperature, precipitation and snowfall to try to find an explanation for these variations for lakes around Boulder, CO.\n\n\nCode\nggplot(melted_data_lake, aes(x = month_code, y = value, group = lake, color = year)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_smooth()+\n  facet_wrap(~lake, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  labs(title = \"Seasonal Variations of Lake Surface\",\n       x = \"Month\",\n       y = \"Surface sq.kms\") +\n  theme_minimal()+\n  theme(\n    axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\nMissing data makes this plot harder to interpret as it causes the large surface decrease in autumn in many of the plots.\nFor the most part, no clear seasonal tendency appears:\n\nTwo lakes have an important decrease during spring.\nTwo have relatively stable surfaces throughout the year\nTwo have their surface increasing during spring and decreasing afterward.\n\nWe can thus see that the trends highlighted in the previous paragraph are specific to glacier-fed lakes."

During the winter, snowfalls don’t impact the surface of the lake as it may be frozen. During the summer, the glacier consistently provides fresh water to the lake making it less dependent on rainfall.\nIn the case of the other lake, it seems like important snowfalls and precipitations are correlated to an increase in surface. This seems logical: this lake is partly filled by rainfall or snowfall."

    "title": "5  Conclusion",
    "section": "",
    "text": "In global, permafrost and glacier-fed lakes account for a third of fresh water lake surface. Permafrost and glacier are key for fresh water access in two types of regions:\n\nHigh latitude regions: where the low amount of solar radiations per sq.km reaching the ground allows for part of the land to remain frozen all year long. The partial melting provides fresh water to downstream lakes.\nHigh altitude regions: glacier existing in mountainous areas provide water to downstream lakes when melting during the summer.\n\nIn North America, Canada and Alaska deeply rely on permafrost for fresh water. In the US, a few communities in the Rocky Mountains rely on glacier-fed lakes.\nAfter studying the surface variations of six glacier-fed lakes in the Rocky Mountains, we cannot conclude that glacier retreat has had an impact on lake surface between 1985 and 2020. We believe that this is due to the glacier still providing the around the same amount of water while they exist and are of sufficient size as the melting rate during the summer is sustained. This doesn’t mean that this fresh water source won’t be impacted. The glaciers from the Rocky Mountains will disappear before 2050 and won’t be able to provide for the area anymore.\nThe seasonal variations of lake surface of glacier-fed are very specific and temperature-related. The high temperatures during the summer cause the glacier to melt leading to an increase of lake surface. The steady melting rate during the summer provides a consistent amount of water to downstream lakes making them less precipitation dependent. In comparison, other lakes that aren’t glacier-fed suffer from evaporation during the summer - their surface decreases with high temperature - and are highly dependent on precipitations - their surface increases with snowfalls and rainfalls.\nIn the past, glacier-fed lakes have been a reliable fresh water source during drought as they don’t rely heavily on precipitations. Glaciers act as reservoirs, storing water from winter snowfalls and releasing it in summer. This mechanism also operates over several years, for example in the case of a particularly snowy year or a particularly dry year. As this source of fresh water is set to disappear, these regions will probably become more vulnerable to drought."
